&nbsp; There is a general rule in finance that oneâ€™s housing costs should account for no more than 33% of their household income. We are looking to estimate if one can stay within the 33% allotment given a dataset on home price and income information. We will train our model on this dataset to see what way home prices versus household income are trending in the coming years to find the affordability of owning a home in the United States.
